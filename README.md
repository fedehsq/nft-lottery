# TRY: a nfT lotteRY

## Description
The goal of the project is to implement TRY, a lottery offering users collectibles 
as winning prizes. \
The rules of the lottery are inspired by Powerball, a popular 
type of lottery played in the United States. \
The lottery logic must be implemented with a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. \
Before  operating the lottery, the lottery manager buys a batch of collectibles, and mints a Non Fungible Token (NFT) for each of them. \
Each lotteryâ€™s winner may receive as a prize one of these collectibles.
